    <h1>ABOUT WAYNE</h1>
    <P>Wayne Imbuga is a student at Strathmore University. He is pursuing a degree in Business Information Technology.
        From a young age, Wayne had a passion for "computers" despite not knowing in details what he wanted to specialise
        in. As years went by and it was time to join university, he wanted to pursue computer science. At Strathmore, he
        was told that he unfortunately could not join the program but that did not stop him. He therefore opted to enroll
        in BBIT.<br>
        Wayne has a vision to specialise in Cyber Security and slowly delve into Machine learning. His journey as a software
        engineer is still bright and he hopes for a lot.
